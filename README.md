Dpatcher-IOS
============

A file patcher for Destinia written for IOS, basically a cheatInstalling the iphone SDK is as easy as going to cydia finding bigboss recommended installing then using terminal installtheos3.

afterwards you can compile this :D

basically the code for this is really really sloppy as i was just looking for a functional port.

anyhow once youve got this setup on your iphone/ipod/ipad do this in terminal ./deploy that will compile and install it to /Application/dpatcher.app assuming you created the folder
